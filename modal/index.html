        <p>Soon enough. Of all the friends I've had… you're the first. Meh. I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there! No, she'll probably make me do it.</p>
        <p>Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved. <strong> I'm sure those windmills will keep them cool.</strong> <em> Now what?</em> As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead.</p>
